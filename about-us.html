                <p>
                    PolfWack Tech was born out of a need for simpler and easier development. One common theme the founders of PolfWack Tech
                    noticed throughout the software industry is that developers often make software development more complicated than it needs
                    to be. It is the belief of PolfWack Tech that if developers were just a little more organized, development would be exponentialy faster.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This belief is based off of 2 theories in computer science: object-oriented programming and relational data theory. The theory behind object-oriented 
                    programming is that software is best organized when the it is designed with objects in mind. This allows the programmer to create software based off of
                    these objects, briding the gap between how a computer thinks and how humans think. Relational data theory states that data can be organized by relationship.
                    This makes it easiser to store and retrieve data, because it allows the developers to think about data in terms of relationships.
