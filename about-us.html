                <p>
                    PolfWack Tech was born out of a need for simpler and easier development. One common theme the founders of PolfWack Tech
                    noticed throughout the software industry is that developers often make software development more complicated than it needs
                    to be. It is the belief of PolfWack Tech that if developers were just a little more organized, development would be exponentially faster.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This belief is based off of 2 theories in computer science: object-oriented programming and relational data theory. The theory behind object-oriented 
                    programming is that software is best organized when the it is designed with objects in mind. This allows the programmer to create software based off of
                    these objects, briding the gap between how a computer thinks and how humans think. Relational data theory states that data can be organized by relationship.
                    This makes it easiser to store and retrieve data, because it allows the developers to think about data in terms of relationships. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    PolfWack Tech built off of these 2 theories, and created something they call object-view theory. This theory states all features in an application are the same;
                    they take data from some source and display that for the user. The user then manipulates that data, and the changes to the data are saved. The only thing that is
                    different between features of the application is what data is being stored (the object) and the way the data looks to the user (the view). PolfWack Tech uses this
                    theory to create what they call feature blocks, which are blank features that go into applications. In PolfWack Tech's eyes, software is just a
                    collection of feature blocks, with different objects and different views.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using this way of thinking, PolfWack Tech has created feature blocks for all of the most common features, such as account creation, login, map displays and file uploads.
                    This allows PolfWack Tech to develop elegant pieces of software in a fraction of the time, all while giving you a unique, one-of-a-kind application.
                    PolfWack Tech hopes to change the software industry by making efficient software available to everybody, without breaking the bank.
